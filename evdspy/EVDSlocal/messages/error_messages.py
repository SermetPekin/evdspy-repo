        Program will store your api key in your work environment creating a folder `APIKEY_FOLDER` and read it when 
        it needs to request data from EVDS server. 
        
        This key will be used when you run your requests and will be saved to your work environment 
        in a folder named APIKEY_FOLDER in a text file not as a plane text but in a obscured way. 
        If you are working in a public workspace we suggest that you delete this folder once you are finished making requests.
        Program will not use or store your API key to any other folder therefore when you delete, remove or rename this folder 
        program will ask your API key again.
